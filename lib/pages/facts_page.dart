Then we have professional boxing, which we commonly see on TV. Professional boxing, like amateur boxing, lasts 3 minutes for each round, but there are a total of up to 12 rounds in one competition. Professional boxing focuses more on the physical side, where boxers can take up more punishment before the bout is stopped and is scored mainly by how much you dominated each round. Less known is that a third form of boxing exists—white-collar or semi-professional boxing. It combines professional boxing rules with the number and length of a round from amateur boxing.

The human hands are surprisingly fragile and if you ever watched bare-knuckle boxing, you’ll realise that punches are thrown less frequently in the sport due to this reason. Because of the fragility, athletes practising bare-knuckle boxing will know not to throw punches randomly at full force. However, in boxing, boxing gloves provide cushion to the hands to be able to punch at full force and more frequently. The result? Harder punches are thrown in boxing without hesitation and while it’s less likely to cause external injuries, it causes more internal damage such as concussions that could lead to long-term brain damage. Also, boxing gloves give extra weight to the hands and therefore more kinetic energy to the punches.'),

These are WBC, WBA, IBF, and WBO and these respectively stand for the World Boxing Council, the World Boxing Association, the International Boxing Federation, and the World Boxing Organisation. Each organisation sanctions championship fights. The winner is then granted the title of world champion and a champion’s belt. This is why you hear, for example, “WBC Champion” or “WBA Champion”. If a fighter simultaneously holds several belts but not all four, then he or she is considered the “unified champion.” If the fighter holds all four belts, then he or she is considered the “undisputed champion”. There were many undisputed champions in multiple weight classes such as Oleksandr Usyk in the Cruiserweight class. However, as of 2024, there are only two undisputed champions in both men’s and women’s divisions who earned the title in two weight classes. Terence Crawford and Naoya Inoue in the Men’s division. Katie Taylor and Clarissa Shields in the Women’s division. Every second in the boxing ring is important to the boxers, not only for the belts, medals, or titles they are competing for but also for the honour and passion of the sport.

Equally impressive is his stats: he fought in 49 matches and won by KO in 43 of his bouts, making him have a knockout-to-win ratio of 87.8%! So who’s the other? That is none other than Floyd “Money” Mayweather. He is the most high-profile boxer in the last two decades and the greatest defensive boxer to ever compete.

Back in the golden age of boxing during the 1960s, he was also one of the highest-paid athletes due to his status. However, surprisingly, George Foreman becomes more financially successful as an entrepreneur than as a boxer. This happened when George Foreman endorsed a double-sided electric grill that today bares his name—the George Foreman Grill. The product was a worldwide hit as it sold more than 100 million units. Royalties and selling the right to the product’s name allowed George Foreman to make over \$200 million—substantially more than he made during his boxing career.'),

He rented an entire zoo for the evening. It was when he arrived at the gorilla enclosure that he saw something that didn’t sit with him well: one large silverback gorilla was bullying the other weaker gorillas. It was at this moment that he offered the zookeeper \$10,000 to open the enclosure. In his own words, he wanted to “smash that silverback’s snotbox.” Luckily for the gorilla, the zookeeper declined the offer.'),
